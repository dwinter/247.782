# 247.782 Special Topic in Computational Biology

This repository contains information and assignments for the course "Special
Topics in Computational Biology". 

## Course aims

This course is designed to get postgraduate students up to speed in
computational biology. The course includes hands-on practical examples of 
programming (using Python)  and data management in a unix envrionment. In
addition, the course will give students and opportunity to engage crtically with
published research in computatoinal biology and the opportunities and challanges
associated with genomic technologies. 

The specific learning outcomes are

1. Gain basic proficiency with the python programming language
2. Interpret and synthesise recent research papers in computational biology
3. Be able to explain and interpret research findings and critically asses
   research designs and computational methods.

## Assesment 

### Practical programming task 
**Due**: Week 4
**Weight**: 25%

Clone this repository on to your computer. In the directory `task_1` you will
find two files, `ref.fna` is a very short reference genome and `reads.fq` are
fake sequencing reads aligned to this genome.

Your task is to write a python script that can be called from the command line
and 

1. Converts the fastq file to fasta format
2. Records the positions of bases in the read match the reference sequence in a
   vcf file.

You may use any pre-existing library, google as much as you like and read as
many stackoverflow or biostar questoins as it takes to get an answer to this
task. Some useful links include the [Software Carpentry
Lesson](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-inflammation/) on python, [the
Biopython project](https://biopython.org/) and the [codeacademy python
course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python-3). You can dicuss your
progress on this assesment with colleagues and with David.

The VCF format is [formally defined here](https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/VCFv4.2.pdf)[pdf],
though [the wikipedia page may offer a better
introduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variant_Call_Format). For our
purposes, we need only to use on the CHROM, POS, ID, REF and ALT columns.
